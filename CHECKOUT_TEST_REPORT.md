# Checkout Flow Test Report - Bug Analysis

## Overview
This document reports bugs and issues found during testing of the checkout functionality in the My Demo App iOS application. Testing was conducted on the complete checkout flow including cart management, shipping address, payment method, order review, and order completion.

## Test Environment
- **App**: My Demo App iOS
- **Testing Framework**: XCTest with XCUITest
- **Test Scope**: Checkout flow functionality
- **Date**: July 29, 2025

## Bug Reports

### üêõ Bug #1: Inconsistent Quantity Management Logic
**Severity**: Medium  
**Component**: MyCartViewController  
**File**: `/My Demo App/Controllers/MyCartViewController.swift`  
**Lines**: 166-177

**Description**:
The subtract button logic has inconsistent behavior when reducing quantity to zero.

**Issue**:
```swift
@objc func subtractButton(_ sender: UIButton) {
    let productFound = Engine.sharedInstance.cartList[sender.tag]
    let quantity =  productFound.value(forKey: "ProductQuantity") as! Int - 1
    
    if quantity < 1 {
        Engine.sharedInstance.cartList.remove(at: sender.tag)
    }
    
    productFound.setValue(quantity, forKey: "ProductQuantity")  // ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE: Sets quantity to 0 even after removing item
    Engine.sharedInstance.cartCount -= 1
    totalItemLbl.text = String(Engine.sharedInstance.cartCount) + " Items"
    cartCountLbl.text = String(Engine.sharedInstance.cartCount)
    calculateTotalPrice ()
    self.productTV.reloadData()
}
```

**Expected Behavior**: When quantity reaches 0, item should be removed and no further operations should be performed on the removed object.

**Actual Behavior**: The code attempts to set quantity to 0 on an object that has already been removed from the array, which could cause a crash or data inconsistency.

**Recommendation**: Move the `setValue` operation before the removal logic or add proper guards.

### üêõ Bug #2: Missing Form Validation Logic in Payment Screen
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: PaymentMethodViewController  
**File**: `/My Demo App/Controllers/PaymentMethodViewController.swift`  
**Lines**: 106-139

**Description**:
The payment form validation has incomplete logic flow that could allow invalid data to proceed.

**Issue**:
```swift
@IBAction func reviewOrderButton(_ sender: Any) {
    if(!fullNameCardTF.hasText){
        Methods.showAlertMessage(vc: self, title: "Validation Error!", message: "Value looks invalid.")
    }
    if(!cardNumberTF.hasText){
        Methods.showAlertMessage(vc: self, title: "Validation Error!", message: "Value looks invalid.")
    }
    if (!expirationDateTF.hasText){
        Methods.showAlertMessage(vc: self, title: "Validation Error!", message: "Value looks invalid.")
    }
    // ... more validation checks ...
    
    // ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE: Navigation always happens regardless of validation failures
    let storyboard = UIStoryboard.init(name: "TabBar", bundle: nil)
    let vc = storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "ReviewYourOrderViewController") as! ReviewYourOrderViewController
    vc.isBillingSame = isBillingSame
    self.navigationController?.pushViewController(vc, animated: true)
}
```

**Expected Behavior**: Navigation should only occur if all validations pass.

**Actual Behavior**: The navigation to the review screen happens even when validation errors are displayed.

**Recommendation**: Use early returns or a comprehensive validation flag to prevent navigation when validation fails.

### üêõ Bug #3: Potential UI State Inconsistency
**Severity**: Medium  
**Component**: MyCartViewController  
**File**: `/My Demo App/Controllers/MyCartViewController.swift`  
**Lines**: 123-126

**Description**:
The cart count UI update logic doesn't properly handle edge cases.

**Issue**:
```swift
if productQuantity! < 1 {
    cell.subtractButton.isUserInteractionEnabled = false
}
```

**Expected Behavior**: Subtract button should be disabled when quantity is 1 (to prevent going below 1) or when the item is about to be removed.

**Actual Behavior**: The condition checks for `< 1` which means the button is only disabled after the quantity has already reached 0, which might be too late.

**Recommendation**: Change condition to `<= 1` or implement proper state management.

---

### üêõ Bug #4: Missing Security Code Validation
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: PaymentMethodViewController  
**File**: `/My Demo App/Controllers/PaymentMethodViewController.swift`  
**Lines**: 106-139

**Description**:
The security code field (CVV) is not validated in the payment form submission.

**Issue**:
The `reviewOrderButton` method validates card holder name, card number, and expiration date, but completely skips security code validation.

**Expected Behavior**: Security code should be validated for presence and format (3-4 digits).

**Actual Behavior**: Users can proceed to checkout without entering a security code.

**Impact**: This could lead to payment processing failures or security vulnerabilities.

**Recommendation**: Add security code validation similar to other fields.

---

### üêõ Bug #5: Inconsistent Item Count Display
**Severity**: Low  
**Component**: ReviewYourOrderViewController  
**File**: `/My Demo App/Controllers/ReviewYourOrderViewController.swift`  
**Line**: 74

**Description**:
Inconsistent singular/plural form in item count display.

**Issue**:
```swift
totalItemLbl.text = String(Engine.sharedInstance.cartCount) + "item"
```

**Expected Behavior**: Should display "1 item" for single item and "X items" for multiple items.

**Actual Behavior**: Always displays "Xitem" without space and without proper plural form.

**Recommendation**: Implement proper pluralization logic.

---

### üêõ Bug #6: Hard-coded Shipping Cost
**Severity**: Medium  
**Component**: ReviewYourOrderViewController  
**File**: `/My Demo App/Controllers/ReviewYourOrderViewController.swift`  
**Line**: 74

**Description**:
Shipping cost is hard-coded in the total calculation.

**Issue**:
```swift
totalPriceLbl.text = "$" + String(format: "%.2f", Engine.sharedInstance.totalPrice + 5.99)
```

**Expected Behavior**: Shipping cost should be configurable or calculated based on shipping method.

**Actual Behavior**: $5.99 shipping is always added regardless of shipping method or location.

**Impact**: Reduces flexibility for different shipping options or free shipping promotions.

**Recommendation**: Move shipping cost to a configurable parameter or implement shipping calculation logic.

   ```

## Recommendations for Bug Fixes

### Immediate Priority (High Severity):

## Test Automation Framework

The tests are built using:

- **Page Object Pattern**: For maintainable test code
- **Comprehensive Assertions**: To validate both positive and negative scenarios

This framework choice ensures:
- ‚úÖ Native iOS support

- ‚úÖ Detailed test reporting
- ‚úÖ Screenshot capture on failures
- ‚úÖ Support for real device testing

## Conclusion

The checkout functionality has several critical bugs that should be addressed before production release. The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the checkout flow and will help ensure these issues are properly resolved and don't regress in future releases.
